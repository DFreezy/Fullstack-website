                DFreezy created by Duwayne. Really the name comes form highschool friends
                Anyway. From a young age I had a unique talent to absorb information very fast
                I always try to master everything I am interested in. I believe I have the grit and determination to take a project
                from start to finish and also start up a new one right after based on my rigorous experience at Codespace where
                I had to submit two projects a week.
